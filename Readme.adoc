== Overview & Architecture

=== Network Requirements

 - HIRO Engine Node \<\-> HIRO Repository (for ActionHandler Components)
 - HIRO Engine Node \<\-> CentOS Repository (for Kerberos Workstation Components)
 - HIRO Engine Node \<\-> CentOS SCL Repository (during installation)
 - HIRO Engine Node \<\-> Windows Targets on ports 5985 (HTTP) and/or 5986 (HTTPS)
 - HIRO Engine Node \<\-> Windows Domain Controller on Kerberos Ports

=== Permissions

 - An AD Account that is part of the Domain Administrators group

== WinRM ActionHandler Installation

Activate the SCL repository:

- On CentOS:
[source,console]
----
yum -y install centos-release-scl-rh
----

- On RHEL:
[source,console]
----
subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-6-server-optional-rpms
subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-server-rhscl-6-rpms
----

Add the following to your `/etc/yum.repos.d/hiro.repo` file:
[source,ini]
----
[hiro-contrib]
name=arago HIRO contributions
baseurl=https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@repository.arago.de/hiro-contrib/centos/6/
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1
----
Replace `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` with your repository credentials.

[TIP]
====
* For **Free Edition:** The repository credentials or the same as
for your https://accounts.graphit.co[arago ID].
* For **Enterprise Edition:** You use your [underline]#arago ID#
credentials. Usually the AI Projects team will provide you with a
separate user for repository access.
====


[TIP]
====
To use the online RPM repository the target servers need to be able to connect to [underline]#tcp/443# on "repository.arago.de".
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
If your username/password contains special characters
you must replace them with the proper http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp[URL encode] character.
====

Install the ActionHandler from the Repository and start the service:
[source,console]
----
yum install hiro_integration-winrm-actionhandler

service hiro-winrm-actionhandler start
service hiro-winrm-actionhandler status
----

== Kerberos Client Installation & Configuration

On the HIRO Engine Node install the Kerberos workstation components:
[source,console]
----
yum install krb5-libs krb5-workstation
----

Modify the Kerberos config */etc/krb5.conf* to include the domain information.

krb5.conf sample:
```
[logging]
 default = FILE:/var/log/krb5libs.log
 kdc = FILE:/var/log/krb5kdc.log
 admin_server = FILE:/var/log/kadmind.log

[libdefaults]
 default_realm = WINLAB.LOCAL     <1>
 dns_lookup_realm = false
 dns_lookup_kdc = false
 ticket_lifetime = 24h
 renew_lifetime = 7d
 forwardable = true

[realms]
 WINLAB.LOCAL = {     <2>
  kdc = dc1.winlab.local     <3>
  admin_server = dc1.winlab.local     <4>
 }

[domain_realm]
 .winlab.local = WINLAB.LOCAL     <5>
 winlab.local = WINLAB.LOCAL     <6>
```

Use kinit to manually test Kerberos authentication:
[source,console]
----
kinit user@WINLAB.LOCAL
----

The command *klist* should now show a valid Kerberos TGT.

Run the command *kdestroy* to remove the above ticket, as it was only for testing.

== Create a Keytab File

On the HIRO Engine Node, use the following series of commands to create our Keytab file:
[source,console]
----
ktutil
addent -password -p username@MYDOMAIN.COM -k 1 -e RC4-HMAC
- enter password for username -
wkt username.keytab
----
TIP: link:http://www.itadmintools.com/2011/07/creating-kerberos-keytab-files.html[Sample instructions can be found here]

The default location for keytabs is `/opt/autopilot/conf/external_actionhandlers/keytabs/`.

Test Keytab file:
[source,console]
----
kinit -k -t /path/to/Keytab user@DOMAIN
----
*klist* should now show a valid Kerberos TGT.
*kdestroy* will remove the ticket.

NOTE: HIRO will need permissions to access the keytab file to be able to utilize it

== Configure the HIRO Engine
Add the following section to your `/opt/autopilot/conf/aae.yaml` and restart the engine.

[source,yaml]
----
ActionHandlers:
  ActionHandler:
    - URL: tcp://127.0.0.1:7289
      SubscribeURL: ''
      CapabilityYAML: /opt/autopilot/conf/external_actionhandlers/capabilities/winrm-actionhandler.yaml
      RequestTimeout: 60
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you're still using HIRO 5.3.x, replace `CapabilityYAML` by `CapabilityXML` and `winrm-actionhandler.yaml` by `winrm-actionhandler.xml`
====

== Configure the WinRM ActionHandler
To adjust the number of actions that can be executed concurrently
(both in total and per MARSNode), edit
`/opt/autopilot/conf/external_actionhandlers/winrm-actionhandler.conf`
[source,ini]
----
[ActionHandler]
ZMQ_URL: tcp://*:7289
ParallelTasks: 10
ParallelTasksPerWorker: 5
WorkerMaxIdle: 300
----

[width="100%",options="header"]
|====
| Option| Default| Meaning

| ParallelTasks| 10| Number of overall commands the ActionHandler will execute in parallel. Additional commands will be enqueued.
| ParallelTasksPerWorker| 5| Number of commands the ActionHandler will execute in parallel on the same target machine.
|====

To apply the changes, restart the ActionHandler
[source,console]
----
service hiro-winrm-actionhandler restart
----

== Configuring a Target Windows Server

Windows has a command for WinRM "Quick Configuration":

[source,console]
----
Set-wsmanquickconfig
----

Check if WinRM service is already running:
[source,console]
----
Get-Service WinRM
----

Check the WinRM service configuration:
[source,console]
----
winrm g winrm/config/Service
----

Sample output:
```
Service
    RootSDDL = O:NSG:BAD:P(A;;GA;;;BA)(A;;GR;;;IU)S:P(AU;FA;GA;;;WD)(AU;SA;GXGW;;;WD)
    MaxConcurrentOperations = 4294967295
    MaxConcurrentOperationsPerUser = 1500
    EnumerationTimeoutms = 240000
    MaxConnections = 300
    MaxPacketRetrievalTimeSeconds = 120
    AllowUnencrypted = true    <1>
    Auth
        Basic = false
        Kerberos = true        <2>
        Negotiate = true
        Certificate = false
        CredSSP = false
        CbtHardeningLevel = Relaxed
    DefaultPorts
        HTTP = 5985
        HTTPS = 5986
    IPv4Filter = *
    IPv6Filter = *
    EnableCompatibilityHttpListener = false
    EnableCompatibilityHttpsListener = false
    CertificateThumbprint
    AllowRemoteAccess = true
```
<1> Only required if we are accessing the server over HTTP. Can be changed with command: winrm s winrm/config/Service '@{AllowUnencrypted="True"}'
<2> This should be true by default. Can be changed with command: winrm s winrm/config/Service/Auth '@{Kerberos="True"}'

Check for running Listeners:
[source,console]
----
winrm e winrm/config/listener
----

Sample output:
```
Listener
    Address = *
    Transport = HTTP
    Port = 5985
    Hostname
    Enabled = true
    URLPrefix = wsman
    CertificateThumbprint
    ListeningOn = 127.0.0.1, 192.168.105.240, ::1, fe80::5efe:192.168.105.240%15, fe80::ffff:ffff:fffe%14
```

== Installation & Configuration Troubleshooting

=== Kerberos Configuration Troubleshooting

[IMPORTANT] Kerberos has a lot of DNS sensitivities. Make sure DNS entries resolve correctly and systems are reachable.

```
kinit: Client not found in Kerberos database while getting initial credentials
```
This error was encountered when an incorrect username (or principal) was used

```
kinit: Preauthentication failed while getting initial credentials
```
This error was encountered when the password for the user (or principal) was entered incorrectly

=== Keytab Creation Troubleshooting

```
kinit: Keytab contains no suitable keys for host/fqdn.local@FQDN.LOCAL while getting initial credentials
```
Command entered may be missing the principal (did not have username@DOMAIN) but instead had just the keytab

Helpful commands:
```
klist -kte /path/to/keytab
```

=== Configuration Test Troubleshooting

```
Command excecution failed:
Authentication failed.
```

Individually test the credentials and keytab files using kinit.
Ensure all needed parameters are present (such as Keytab and Username).

```
WinRM script returns:
the specified credentials were rejected by the server
```
Make sure user is both a local and domain administrator.

=== Additional ActionHandler Troubleshooting

A log is kept in `/var/log/autopilot/engine/winrm-handler.log` which could contain useful troubleshooting information.

We encountered an issue in where we received HTTP 503 when trying to execute a command against a target Windows Server. This was because HTTP_PROXY was set on the HIRO Engine Node and was intercepting HTTP traffic (even if it was on port 5985). Adding unset http_proxy to the init script resolved this issue temporarily and a feature request was logged so that this could be resolved in the future.

== ActionHandler Usage
The WinRM ActionHandler provides two 'Capabilities':

* `ExecuteCommand`: Execute standard DOS commands
* `ExecutePowershell`: Execute Powershell commands

Both capabilities support the execution of small scripts in their
respective language (DOS batch or Powershell).

IMPORTANT: The length of the whole script including all whitespace and line breaks
must not exceed 5500 characters.

`ExecuteCommand` is named exactly like in the Unix ActionHandler for
a reason: It does the same thing, executing a command.

Both ActionHandlers are limited by their `Applicability`. The Unix
ActionHandler will only work with Unix machines, the WinRM handler
only with Windows machines. Which one is used for execution depends
on the `MachineClass` of the `MARSNode` the `AutomationIssue`
resides on when the ActionHandler is called.

To learn more about `Capabilities` and `Applicabilities`, please
refer to the https://docs.hiro.arago.co/hiro/5.4.2/install-config/completing/generic-ah.html[documentation of the Generic ActionHandler].


=== Example ===
Usage is analogous to the Unix ActionHandlers:
